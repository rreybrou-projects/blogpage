## Introduction 
 
"What do you do when you break your smartphone screen? Or when your laptop starts to slow down after just a few years of use? We rely on highly complex electronics in our daily lives, which are prone to breaking, malfunctioning, or underperforming for various reasons. In this blog post, I want to briefly highlight some of my experiences with electronic repairs and share my perspective on keeping devices updated. These somewhat technical skills have proven to be very useful over the past few years, and I'd like to encourage those interested in DIY electronics repair.

## My Lenovo Ideapad Yoga 13

It must have been around 2016 when I first dared to work on electronics. My Lenovo Ideapad Yoga 13 laptop came with a 4GB RAM memory card, which I swapped out for an 8GB one. I needed more CPU power to comfortably learn 3D-CAD drawing and programming. Following the easy steps of a helpful tutorial, I managed to double my CPU power. I remember how smoothly the installation went and the satisfaction of successfully upgrading such a complex piece of equipment. This simple upgrade has proven to be very cost-effective, as I am still using it to type these words in 2024.

Fast forward to 2024, and I am amazed at how well this laptop has kept up with modern software. A good example was when I was creating this blog post while simultaneously running CPU-intensive applications on two monitors without major problems. Although the responsiveness is not the best, it is still quite satisfactory.

Over the years, I have had to make necessary repairs to keep my machine functioning. I replaced the LCD screen after breaking the original and installed a new cooling fan after it started making a [terrible noise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQcS9Z4EBKU). The noise sometimes returns when I pick up the PC while it's running, so I've just decided to treat it as an immobile computer. üòÖ The desktop occasionally gets the bluescreen, but I don't mind. We all have our moments, right?"

These upgrades not only provided me with additional RAM or saved money that I would have otherwise spent on a new laptop or repairs, but more importantly, they gave me the confidence I needed to work on electronics. These experiences and skill sets are invaluable to me because they've introduced me to the wonderful DIY world of repair guides, tutorials, tips, and tricks.

My next plan for my cherished Lenovo is to install a [lightweight Linux distribution](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/lightweight-linux-distributions-for-your-pc/#:~:text=Lightweight%20Linux%20distros%20are%20perfect,from%20a%20minimalist%20Linux%20distro) instead of continuing with Windows 10. It's well known that installing a Linux distro can lead to significant performance gains and extend the usability lifetime of computers. While changing the operating system might sound like a challenging task, it isn't that complex once you're able to enter and navigate the [BIOS](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/BIOS-basic-input-output-system).

## Smartphone's & broken screens

I hope you can't relate, but I've learned the hard way how to take care of my cellphone. Over the years, I've broken multiple phone screens as they systematically grew bigger. And I'm not alone. According to an article from 2019, only a minority (about 35%) has never broken their phone screen. As phones became smarter, they also became more fragile, as evidenced by [internet discussions](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/subcultures/indestructible-nokia-3310).

Feeling comfortable opening up computers, starting with screen replacements for myself, friends, and family wasn't a big step. Sourcing a replacement screen, acquiring the right tools, and following tutorials along with some 'fingerspitzengef√ºhl' (intuitive skill) and tips & tricks got the DIY job done. However, I would still highly recommend professionals whenever in doubt or when dealing with a more complex model.

## Outro

In a world where phones are becoming more fragile and software demands increasingly performant computers, I believe it's only natural to adopt circular and repair techniques. There are multiple benefits to be gained, not only in terms of cost-effectiveness and sustainability but also in terms of education and information. Personally, I prefer to repair whenever possible and encourage others to do the same. Having the ability to repair your electronics empowers you as a user and consumer.

Recently, I've become aware of a fantastic local initiative focused on [sharing of unused ICT equipment](https://repairshare.be/deel-it-boost-digi-gevers/) and [supporting people digitally](https://repairshare.be/deel-it-boost-digi-helpers/). I love the idea that once my equipment has served me sufficiently, it can still be utilized by someone else, especially someone who needs a less performance-demanding computer, for instance. This blog post has motivated me to search for more local communities and initiatives focused on sharing and repairing equipment.‚ôªÔ∏è
